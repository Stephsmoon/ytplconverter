# ytplconverter  
Simple youtube playlist converter made for a friend  
Made by Stephmoon with help from the pytube api  

## Setup:  

> * Find a Compiler which can run Python Code. You may need to install Python on your device, which if you do run a simple hello world script on your Compiler to test. Make sure your compiler can handle inputs (Recommendation: use SublimeText3, you will need to download python3 on your computer. Once you have done this then install the terminus package and use that to run the python file- terminus will run the file through a terminal on your SublimeText3 which will allow inputs)  
> * Install the pytube api through the command: pip install pytube  
> * Run the ytplconverter.py on your Compiler and it will ask for the url of your playlist
